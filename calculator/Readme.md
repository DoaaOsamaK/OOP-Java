# 🧮 Java Calculator 📙

A simple calculator application built using Java Swing for a graphical user interface (GUI). This project demonstrates the use of basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java.

## Features ✨

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- **Simple and Intuitive GUI**: Easy-to-use interface with buttons for digits and operations
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages for invalid inputs

# Code Structure 🏗️

**Calculator.java**: The main class that extends `JFrame` and implements `ActionListener` to handle the GUI and user interactions.

# How It Works 🛠️

The `Calculator` class uses the following OOP principles:

- **Encapsulation**: Uses private instance variables to store the state of the calculator.
- **Inheritance**: Inherits from `JFrame` to create a windowed application.
- **Polymorphism**: Implements `ActionListener` to handle different types of button clicks uniformly.
- **Abstraction**: Hides the complex evaluation logic behind simple method calls.

# Example Usage 📖

1. Launch the application.
2. Click on the buttons to input numbers and operations.
3. Press "=" to calculate the result.
4. Clear the display using the "C" button.
